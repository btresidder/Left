Collapsible Investigation
=========================

This is an investigation into collapsible text boxes for sphinx.
This is regular text written in the .rst file.
Below is an attempt at making a collapsible box.

.. raw:: html
   <details>
   <summary<a>Press here to open box</a></summary>
   <p>This is a bunch of text I have written.</p>
   </details>

Here is some more text outside of the collapsible to see what it will do.
